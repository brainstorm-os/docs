Brainstorm is a desktop shell that hosts **apps** — and nothing else. Notes, Database, Graph, Calendar, the whole product is apps running over one shared [object layer](/concepts/objects/). The same model is open to you: an app you build is a peer of the built-in ones, with the same access to vault data and the same place in the launcher.

This section is the developer hub for building those apps. It assumes you've read the [Concepts](/concepts/vaults/) — especially [Apps & permissions](/concepts/apps-and-permissions/) and [Objects](/concepts/objects/) — because the platform's guarantees *are* its API.

:::note
You don't need a toolchain to start. An app is two files — a `manifest.json` and an `index.html` — and you can write them in the built-in [Code editor](/apps/code-editor/#build-an-app-then-install-it) and install straight from your vault, no build step and no terminal. Brainstorm also installs from a folder on disk or a `.brainstorm` bundle, and the building blocks are published on npm under `@brainstorm-os` — tokens, types, the React-Yjs hooks, Block Protocol, the SDK, and the editor.

## What an app is

An app is a small web app — HTML, JavaScript, CSS — that runs in its own sandboxed renderer. It ships with a [manifest](/build/the-manifest/) that declares who it is, what data types it owns, and which [capabilities](/build/capabilities/) it needs. The shell installs it, gives it a window, and brokers every request it makes to the system.

Three properties define the model:

- **Sandboxed.** An app can't reach the filesystem, the network, or another app on its own. It can only do what you've granted through the capability ledger. Sideloaded apps are additionally marked unsigned and held to a stricter trust tier. This is the security boundary — it's what makes it safe to run third-party apps and autonomous agents over your most important data.
- **Capability-gated.** Every sensitive action maps to a named capability the app declared and you approved. Nothing is ambient; checks fail closed. See [Capabilities](/build/capabilities/).
- **Over shared objects.** Apps don't own private silos. They read and write typed [objects](/concepts/objects/) in the vault, so the note you write in one app is the same object another app can link to, show on a calendar, or place on a graph.

## What you build with

Every Brainstorm app is a **React app** built on one shared toolkit:

- **`@brainstorm/sdk`** — the component and helper library: menus, popovers, icons, pickers, property UI, search, find-and-replace, formatting, and the app-chrome theme. Check the [SDK & runtime](/build/the-sdk/) before writing anything; if a primitive exists, you import it rather than rebuild it.
- **`@brainstorm/react-yjs`** — the reactivity layer. Live entity lists and collaborative documents flow through hooks like `useVaultEntities` and `useYDoc`. You never hand-roll a change loop.
- **`window.brainstorm`** — the runtime the shell injects into every app: your identity, your granted capabilities, your launch context, and the [service namespaces](/build/the-sdk/#the-runtime) (`entities`, `files`, `intents`, `storage`, `search`, …) you call to do work.

## The shape of the work

A typical app is four things:

1. A **[manifest](/build/the-manifest/)** declaring the app, the object types it owns, and the capabilities it needs.
2. A **React UI** mounted into the app window, using the standard [header chrome](/build/the-sdk/#app-chrome) and SDK components.
3. **[Data access](/build/working-with-data/)** — reading and writing entities, syncing rich text through Yjs, storing app-private state.
4. **[Integration](/build/working-with-data/#talking-to-other-apps)** — registering as an opener for a type, dispatching intents, contributing widgets, so your app composes with the rest of the workspace instead of standing alone.

## Where to go next

- **[Your first app](/build/your-first-app/)** — scaffold, run, and see an app in the shell.
- **[The manifest](/build/the-manifest/)** — every field, with a real example.
- **[Capabilities](/build/capabilities/)** — the permission grammar and how to ask for access.
- **[SDK & runtime](/build/the-sdk/)** — the toolkit and the `window.brainstorm` surface.
- **[Working with data](/build/working-with-data/)** — entities, documents, storage, and cross-app integration.
- **[Recipes & anti-patterns](/build/recipes/)** — the patterns to copy and the mistakes to avoid.
